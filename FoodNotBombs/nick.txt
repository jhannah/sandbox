Each week, a pile of boxes is stacked at the delivery bay of Whole Foods
Market. The hardy cardboard brims with potatoes and onions, turnips and
celery, apples and strawberries. Some of it is not pretty. Bruised and
misshapen, getting close to expiration. Unsellable. But not inedible.

These boxes would be thrown out soon if not for the white truck. If not for
the volunteers. The boxes are salvaged, sorted, and served to the good
people of Omaha, rich and poor, stoned and sober…those who believe in
our movement, and even those who don’t. But we believe.

We believe in goodness and compassion. We believe in kindness and love.
We believe in the god of a hot meal and an honest smile. We believe in
warm cider on a cold day.

We believe in hope and abundance. We believe in decades of struggle and
progress. We believe that we’re living in the first days of a better
nation. We believe in tomorrow.

What do you believe? In food for every person? In a roof over every
head? In relationship to the natural world? In revolutionary love? In
music? In poetry? In technology that serves us all?

There’s a spot for you here. It’s good that you’ve arrived. Because none
of this is possible without you. And we’re all ready to begin.
